You are editing the existing Kake project.

Rules:
- Do NOT narrate your steps.
- Do NOT generate markdown summaries or docs.
- Just update the code so it compiles and works.

GOAL
----
Make the **About page** use the **same colour scheme and general visual style as the Landing page**.

Right now:
- The About page hero section has a strong purple gradient and cupcake background.
- The Landing page hero uses the Kake cream/champagne background and chocolate/brown typography with gold/orange accent buttons.
- I want the About page to visually match the landing page style (same palette, same feel), while keeping the existing About content (text + sections like “The Kake Story”, “Our Journey”, “Meet the Team”, “Visit Us”).

PART 1 – REUSE LANDING PAGE THEME / TOKENS
------------------------------------------
Identify the theme tokens / Tailwind classes used on the landing hero section (things like `bg-kake-cream-50`, `text-kake-chocolate-600`, primary button colours, etc.).

Update the About page root and hero section component (e.g. `UV_About.tsx` or similar) so that:

- The hero background uses the SAME background colour / gradient as the landing hero (no more purple overlay).
- Headline and subtitle use the same font family and colours as the landing hero headline and subtitle.
- Any primary CTA button on the About page uses the same button styles as the “Choose Your Location” button on the landing page (same background, hover states, border radius, etc.).

Remove or disable:
- The purple gradient background.
- Any strong purple overlay on the hero background image.
- Any leftover purple theme colours that clash with the landing palette.

If a background image is still desired, keep it subtle: low opacity or soft blend so the cream / warm tone still dominates, like on the landing hero.

PART 2 – PAGE BACKGROUND & SECTION COLOURS
------------------------------------------
Ensure the overall **About page background** matches the landing page:

- Use the same light cream / off-white page background as the landing page, not the cooler grey or purple tones.
- Sections like “The Kake Story” and “Our Journey” should sit on the same cream base with brown text, just like the landing “Why Choose Kake?” section.

Where the About page currently uses purple or blue tones for headings or separators:

- Replace them with the same chocolate/brown colour used for main headings on the landing page.
- Use the same accent colour (gold/orange) for small highlights (lines, icons, etc.), mirroring the landing design.

PART 3 – “Meet the Team” & “Visit Us” Card Styling
--------------------------------------------------
For the **Meet the Team** section:

- Keep the layout and content, but update colours to align with the landing theme:
  - Background behind the team section should be the same light page background as other sections (no different grey/blue zone).
  - Card titles (names & roles) use the same text colours as headings/subheadings on the landing page.
  - Replace any purple heart icon / accent with the same accent colour used for primary UI elements on the landing page (the gold/orange tone).

For the **Visit Us** cards at the bottom of the About page:

- Replace the bright pink/purple gradient card headers with a style consistent with the landing “Our Locations” cards:
  - Use the same card background, border radius, and shadow as the location cards on the landing.
  - Use chocolate/brown text and the same icon colour as the landing location cards.
- Ensure “Today: 09:00–19:00” and “Closed Today” badges use accent colours that already exist in the landing palette (e.g. soft gold/orange, muted red for closed), not bright neon or purple.

PART 4 – CONSISTENCY & RESPONSIVENESS
-------------------------------------
- Make sure typography scales and spacing on the About page match the landing page:
  - Same heading sizes for H1/H2/H3 where appropriate.
  - Consistent vertical spacing between sections.
- Keep the page fully mobile responsive:
  - On mobile, hero text should remain clearly readable against the new background.
  - Team and Visit Us cards should stack similarly to how location cards stack on the landing page.

PART 5 – NO FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
------------------------------
- Do NOT change any routing, data fetching, or content text.
- Only adjust styling / CSS / Tailwind classes to ensure:
  - The About page looks like part of the same design system as the Landing page.
  - All purple/pink gradients and mismatched colours are replaced with the Kake landing palette.

After the changes, the user experience should feel seamless when switching between Home and About: same cream background, same chocolate headings, same gold/orange accents, and matching card styles.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "You are editing the existing Kake project.

Rules:
- Do NOT narrate your steps.
- Do NOT generate markdown summaries or docs.
- Just update the code so it compiles and works.
